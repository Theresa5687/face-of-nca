    <h4><b>Ensuring and enhancing consumer satisfaction and creating a fair and efficient sector for the various players, playing our role in Government's Digital Economy Agenda,and helping develop Africa's telecommunication's sector are some of the key priorities that drive the work we do here at the national communication authority (NCA)</b></h4>

<div class="top-box ab-klu-b">
    <p>We have over the years continued to demostrate our commitment  living our values,vision and mission and above all mandatevas enshrined in Act 769-the establishing Act of NCA.The authority has continued to do these through 2019 by strengthening its protocols when it comes to enforcing various regulatory compliance.These mechanisms put in place serve multi-purpose benefits to the state,industryand consumers.</p>

     <p>For use to achieve the optimum consumer satisfaction and to ensure that other stakeholders are gaining the maximum benefits from the authority's work,we have over the past year initiated some new regulatory interventons in some cases and also improve other to bring them to global standards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <p>Some of the regulatory interventions we have improved on for the benefit of consumers include ;Internation communication Monitoring Strategies in the areas of (Quality of service,Cybersecurity,and Spectrum Management),Type approval Capacity Building Initiatives with the International telecommunication Union (ITU).</p>

            <h3>Integration Communication Monitoring Strategies</h3>
            <h5><b>Quality of service (Voices and Data)</b></h5>
            <p>This is a very important addition to our enforcement tools.Consumer's legitimate demands for improved quality of service and experience has meant that the authority takes the needed step to ensure that we are able to scientifically measure the output of telecommunication services.This way,the regulator is able to call defaulting mobile network operators to order whiles ensuring that consumers get the best of what they pay for.Ghana's progress in this direction has seen us collabrating with the International Telecommunication Unionto offer quality of service training to professionals within the ITU fraternity. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h5><b>Cybersecurity</b></h5>
            <p>Cybersecurity incident in the telecommunication sector have heightened the urgency of securing this sector by building Cybersecurity capacity,reducing vulnerabilities,reducing malicious activity,proactively issues,cooperating towards Cybersecurity issues, cooperating towards Cybersecurity,responding and recovering from Cybersecurity incident.As the National Cybersecurity Secretariant intensifies its work through the various sectoral computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT), the NCAis proud to have made some useful strides in this direction.We are not where we want to be yet,but we surely are on the right path.Unknowing to the telecommunication consumer in Ghana,the NCA-CERT has prevented a number of potentially in malicious activities which would have had dire consequences on their interest usage.</p>

        <div class=" box">
            <h3><b>Spectrum Management</b></h3>
            <p>One the most fundamental mandates of the National Communication authority is the management of Spectrum.It is also one of thr critical and finite resources. therefore its management is one that requires tact,thoughfulness and a combination of attributes that satisfies the State,Industry and consumers.The authority has strengthened the various machanism to monitor Ghana's spectrum to ensure that it is put on maximum use. Thesa are state of the tools which have made our engineers better equipped to deal with their mandate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Type Approval (Conformance)</h3>
<p>The issuebof standardisation is one of the regulators on the continent and across the world take very seriously.The potential effect of the sub-standard equipment on the population and industry is one that can not be ignored. One of the often misconstrued "perception"about the industry has got to do with emissions and its impact on consumers.We are happy as the regulator to have installed a set of laboratories tha can allow us monitor and enforce regulations on this.Additionally,Ghana is proud to join the Elite group of countries that have this facility globally. Indeed we are only ones with this in West Africa.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box">
            <h3>Capacity Building Initiatives With The Internation Telecommunication Union (ITU)</h3>
            <P>It is important to take congnisance of that,in ensuring and enforciing regulatory compliance in Ghana's Communication Industry. The NCA has equipped its staffeith te requisite training to execute thia mandate.The verve and determination shown by the hardworking men and women of this authority is what has resulted in the recongnitional of the staff and indeed Ghana at various internation platforms including the International Telecommunication Union,Africa Telecommunication Union among others.The authority will continuent to execute its mandateto the full,as it continues to help shape the digitissation plan of the country. </P>
