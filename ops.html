                    <p>Spectrum Management is very important to us here at the NCA. Spectrum, which practically is a finite resource, has to be monitored and managed well for the benefit of all stakeholders. Accordingly, we continue to refine our processess and systems to do this work well. A key part of of the refinement of processess, is the decentralisation of our field (zonal) operations with eight offices throughout the country</p>
